Programs that are erroneously inferred

[c z] if c 1 z  : bool → α → α
                : bool → int → int    when it should be

[a a] a : α → β → β
            Should it typecheck?
            Should the second `a` shadow the first?
            Note: In OCaml is valid to do
                        let f x x = x
                      ∴ val f : α → β → β
